## Contract-Driven Component Registry Architecture

The contract-driven component registry system represents a sophisticated approach to managing design
systems at scale. Let me analyze the key architectural elements and their implications.

### Core Concepts and Architecture

The system builds on **six fundamental concepts**:

- **Components**: Self-contained UI elements with defined interfaces and behaviors
- **Contracts**: Formal specifications defining component APIs, props, events, and behaviors
- **Environments**: Runtime contexts (development, staging, production) with specific configurations
- **Capabilities**: Feature flags and permissions that components can require or provide
- **Mount Plans**: Declarative specifications for component composition and layout
- **Profiles**: Collections of settings, themes, and configurations for different use cases

This architecture enables **contract-first development** where interfaces are defined before
implementation, ensuring consistency and predictability across teams.

### Versioning Strategy

The **SemVer-based versioning** applies to both components and contracts:

```typescript
interface ComponentVersion {
  component: string; // "button"
  version: string; // "2.1.0"
  contractVersion: string; // "1.0.0"
  compatibility: {
    minContract: '1.0.0';
    maxContract: '1.x.x';
  };
}
```

This dual versioning allows components to evolve independently while maintaining contract
compatibility, crucial for large-scale systems where breaking changes must be carefully managed.

### Developer Workflows

**Frontend developers** interact through a streamlined workflow:

1. Browse available components via registry CLI/UI
2. Check contract specifications for integration requirements
3. Install components with automatic dependency resolution
4. Use type-safe interfaces generated from contracts
5. Receive build-time validation against contract violations

**UI engineers** manage the design system through:

1. Theme token management with cascading inheritance
2. Visual regression testing triggered by token changes
3. Component variant creation within contract boundaries
4. Cross-platform token translation (web, native, etc.)

### Task Lattice Framework

The **Task Lattice** represents a paradigm shift from linear task management:

```typescript
interface TaskNode {
  id: string;
  dependencies: string[]; // DAG edges
  capabilities: string[]; // Required system capabilities
  contracts: string[]; // Component contracts used
  stage: 'discovery' | 'design' | 'development' | 'testing' | 'deployment';
  gates: GateRequirement[];
}
```

This **DAG structure** enables:

- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Automatic identification of critical paths
- Dynamic task reordering based on resource availability
- Feedback loop integration for continuous improvement

### Systems Thinking Integration

The framework emphasizes **feedback loops and causal relationships**:

1. **Component usage metrics** feed back into prioritization
2. **Contract violations** trigger automated refactoring suggestions
3. **Visual regression failures** create tasks for design review
4. **Performance degradation** generates optimization tasks

This creates a self-improving system where the component library evolves based on actual usage
patterns.

### Atomic Task Structure

Tasks follow a **rich metadata model**:

```typescript
interface AtomicTask {
  id: string;
  type: 'feature' | 'fix' | 'refactor' | 'test' | 'docs';
  contracts: ContractReference[];
  components: ComponentReference[];
  estimation: {
    complexity: number;
    uncertainty: number;
    dependencies: number;
  };
  validation: {
    acceptance: AcceptanceCriteria[];
    contracts: ContractTest[];
    visual: VisualTest[];
  };
}
```

### Real-World Applications

This architecture excels in scenarios like:

1. **Enterprise design systems** where multiple teams consume shared components
2. **Multi-platform applications** requiring consistent behavior across web/mobile/desktop
3. **Regulated industries** where component behavior must be formally verified
4. **Micro-frontend architectures** where teams deploy independently

The **gated development flow** ensures quality through stage requirements:

- Discovery gates: stakeholder approval, feasibility analysis
- Design gates: accessibility review, design system compliance
- Development gates: contract tests passing, performance budgets met
- Testing gates: visual regression approval, cross-browser validation
- Deployment gates: security scan, documentation complete

This comprehensive approach addresses the complexity of modern frontend development while
maintaining flexibility and developer productivity.
