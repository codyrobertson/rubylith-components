## Results

## Contract Compatibility Matching Logic & Resolution Algorithm

Based on analysis of Material UI, Ant Design, and Storybook's approaches, the contract compatibility
matching should follow a multi-stage resolution process:

**Stage 1: Strict Version Matching**

- Exact version matches take highest priority
- Use semver for range compatibility (^1.0.0, ~1.2.3)
- Cache compatibility results for performance

**Stage 2: Feature Detection**

- Implement capability-based matching similar to Material UI's theme system
- Check for required vs optional contract features
- Use a scoring system: required features = 100 points, optional = 10-50 points based on importance

**Stage 3: Fallback Resolution**

- Define fallback chains for missing capabilities
- Implement adapter patterns for bridging incompatible contracts
- Log compatibility warnings for degraded experiences

```typescript
interface CompatibilityScore {
  score: number; // 0-100
  missingRequired: string[];
  missingOptional: string[];
  adaptersNeeded: AdapterConfig[];
}
```

## Mount Plan Execution Modes

Drawing from Storybook's isolation modes and Ant Design's component mounting strategies:

**Static Mode**

- Pre-rendered at build time
- No runtime dependencies
- Best for documentation, static showcases
- Cache rendered output with content hashing

**Interactive Mode**

- Full runtime with event handlers
- State management integration
- Requires environment capability validation
- Implement sandbox boundaries for security

**Isolated Mode**

- Runs in iframe or shadow DOM
- Complete style isolation
- Independent React/Vue instances
- Perfect for multi-framework environments

Each mode should declare its requirements upfront:

```typescript
interface MountMode {
  type: 'static' | 'interactive' | 'isolated';
  requirements: EnvironmentCapability[];
  isolationLevel: 'none' | 'styles' | 'full';
  performanceProfile: 'minimal' | 'standard' | 'heavy';
}
```

## Token Scope Expansion & Namespace Strategy

Following design token standards from Material Design and Ant Design:

**Namespace Hierarchy**

```
global.color.primary
component.button.color.primary
profile.darkMode.color.primary
```

**Resolution Strategy**

1. Profile tokens (highest priority)
2. Component-specific tokens
3. Theme tokens
4. Global defaults

**Token Inheritance Model**

- Implement CSS custom property-style inheritance
- Support token composition: `color: {ref: 'global.brand.primary'}`
- Add token transformation functions: `darken()`, `opacity()`
- Version tokens independently from components

## Authentication & Authorization Framework

Inspired by npm's scope system and Storybook's access controls:

**Access Roles**

- **Owner**: Full CRUD on components and contracts
- **Maintainer**: Update components, manage versions
- **Contributor**: Submit PRs, suggest changes
- **Consumer**: Read and use components

**Component Visibility Levels**

```typescript
enum Visibility {
  PUBLIC = 'public', // Discoverable by all
  ORGANIZATION = 'org', // Visible to org members
  TEAM = 'team', // Specific team access
  PRIVATE = 'private', // Owner only
}
```

**Namespace Ownership**

- Organizations own namespaces (@company/\*)
- Personal namespaces for individual developers
- Transferable ownership with audit trail

## Extended Success Metrics for Ecosystem Health

Beyond basic metrics, implement comprehensive health indicators:

**Component Quality Score**

- Test coverage percentage
- Documentation completeness
- Accessibility compliance score
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit status

**Ecosystem Vitality Metrics**

- Component interdependency graph health
- Average time to resolve contract conflicts
- Community contribution velocity
- Component reuse factor across projects

**Developer Experience Metrics**

- Time to first successful mount
- Error message clarity score
- API discoverability index
- Support response times

## Contract Versioning Clarification

Implement a three-tier versioning approach:

**1. Contract Schema Version**

- Major changes to contract structure
- Follows strict semver
- Registry maintains multiple schema parsers

**2. Contract Content Version**

- Changes to tokens, themes, capabilities
- Can trigger component updates
- Automatic compatibility testing

**3. Component Implementation Version**

- Independent from contract version
- Can support multiple contract versions
- Version matrix in component metadata

## Environment Compatibility Matrix

**Ownership Model**

- Registry maintains base environment definitions
- Organizations extend with custom environments
- Community can submit environment profiles
- Automated testing validates submissions

**Matrix Structure**

```typescript
interface CompatibilityMatrix {
  environment: EnvironmentProfile;
  supportedContracts: ContractVersionRange[];
  knownIssues: CompatibilityIssue[];
  lastValidated: Date;
  maintainer: string;
}
```

**Maintenance Strategy**

- Automated compatibility testing on updates
- Crowdsourced issue reporting
- Regular deprecation cycles
- Migration guide generation

## Profile Scope & Ownership Model

**Profile Hierarchy**

```
Global Profiles → Organization Profiles → Project Profiles → User Profiles
```

**Ownership Rules**

- Profiles inherit from parent scopes
- Override permissions based on access level
- Audit trail for all profile changes
- Profile templates for common use cases

**Profile Composition**

```typescript
interface ProfileComposition {
  extends: string[]; // Parent profiles
  overrides: TokenOverride[];
  locked: string[]; // Non-overridable tokens
  metadata: ProfileMetadata;
}
```

This approach ensures profiles remain manageable while providing flexibility for customization
across different organizational levels.
