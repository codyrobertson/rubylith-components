# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Token and Theme Resolution System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build system to resolve and validate token references and theme configurations from manifest specifications
# Details:
Implement token resolution engine that: parses token files from specified root directory, handles cascade resolution mode, validates namespace references, resolves theme entry points and provider components, and validates theme variant availability. Support multiple token formats (JSON, JS, DTCG) and theme patterns (React Context, styled-components, CSS custom properties).

# Test Strategy:
Token resolution tests across different formats, theme provider validation tests, namespace resolution accuracy tests, and error handling for missing references

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create environment registration endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build REST API endpoint for registering new environments with authentication and validation
### Details:
Design and implement POST /api/environments endpoint with request/response schemas, authentication middleware, input validation, and database persistence. Include environment metadata like name, type, version, and owner information.

## 2. Build capability declaration system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a structured system for environments to declare their capabilities and features
### Details:
Create capability model with standardized format for declaring features, APIs, protocols, and resources. Design JSON/YAML schema for capability declarations with validation rules and support for nested capabilities.

## 3. Implement capability validation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create validation system to verify declared capabilities meet required standards and formats
### Details:
Build validators for capability schemas, check for required fields, validate data types and formats, ensure capability names follow conventions, and implement custom validation rules for specific capability types.

## 4. Create compatibility checking algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop algorithms to determine if environments are compatible based on their capabilities
### Details:
Implement compatibility matrix logic, version compatibility checks, protocol matching algorithms, dependency resolution, and conflict detection. Include support for partial compatibility and compatibility scores.

## 5. Add environment versioning support [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement versioning system for environments with semantic versioning and migration paths
### Details:
Create version tracking system, implement semantic versioning validation, build version comparison utilities, add version history tracking, and create migration path definitions between versions.

## 6. Build capability matching system [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create intelligent matching system to find environments that meet specific capability requirements
### Details:
Implement query language for capability requirements, build matching engine with scoring algorithms, support fuzzy matching and partial matches, create capability indexes for fast lookups, and implement result ranking.

## 7. Implement health checking and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build system to continuously monitor environment health and capability availability
### Details:
Create health check endpoints, implement periodic capability verification, build monitoring dashboard, set up alerting for capability degradation, track uptime and performance metrics, and implement circuit breaker patterns.

## 8. Add lifecycle management (update/deregister) [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.5, 7.7
### Description: Implement complete lifecycle management for environments including updates and deregistration
### Details:
Build update endpoints for capability changes, implement graceful deregistration with cleanup, create audit trails for lifecycle events, handle dependent resource cleanup, and implement rollback mechanisms for failed updates.
