# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Layout System Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create validation logic for layout system configurations and responsive behavior definitions
# Details:
Build layout validation system that: validates layout system identifiers (grid-12, flexbox, custom), checks responsive configuration validity, validates breakpoint definitions, and ensures layout system compatibility with declared styleEngine. Include support for common layout systems and extensibility for custom configurations.

# Test Strategy:
Layout system validation tests, responsive configuration tests, styleEngine compatibility checks, and custom layout system support tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create layout system identifier validator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build validator to verify layout system identifiers match supported types and configurations
### Details:
Implement validation logic for standard layout identifiers (grid-12, flexbox, custom), create schema for layout system definitions, validate identifier format and naming conventions, ensure identifier uniqueness within configurations

## 2. Build responsive configuration validator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create validator for responsive layout configurations and behavior definitions
### Details:
Validate responsive configuration objects, check breakpoint-specific layout rules, ensure consistent responsive behavior patterns, validate media query integration points

## 3. Implement breakpoint definition validator [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Build validation system for breakpoint definitions including values, naming, and ordering
### Details:
Validate breakpoint value formats and units, ensure logical breakpoint ordering, check naming convention compliance, validate breakpoint ranges for overlaps

## 4. Create styleEngine compatibility checker [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement compatibility validation between layout systems and declared style engines
### Details:
Build compatibility matrix for layout/engine combinations, validate feature support between systems, check for incompatible configuration combinations, provide compatibility warnings and suggestions

## 5. Build grid system configuration validator [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create specialized validator for CSS Grid layout system configurations
### Details:
Validate grid column/row definitions, check grid template configurations, ensure proper grid area naming, validate grid gap and alignment properties

## 6. Implement flexbox layout validator [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.5
### Description: Build validator for flexbox layout system configurations and properties
### Details:
Validate flexbox direction and wrap configurations, check flex item sizing properties, ensure proper alignment and justification settings, validate flex container hierarchy

## 7. Add custom layout system support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.6
### Description: Implement validation framework for custom layout system definitions and extensions
### Details:
Create extensible validation schema for custom layouts, implement plugin architecture for custom validators, provide validation helpers for common custom patterns, ensure custom system registration and discovery

## 8. Create layout system test suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7
### Description: Build comprehensive test coverage for all layout validation components
### Details:
Create unit tests for all validators, build integration test scenarios for complex configurations, implement performance benchmarks for validation operations, develop test fixtures for common layout patterns
