# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Core TOML Parser and Writer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build robust TOML parsing and writing utilities with error handling and format preservation
# Details:
Create TOML parser wrapper around @iarna/toml with enhanced error reporting and line number tracking. Implement TOML writer that preserves formatting and comments. Add utilities for reading/writing design-system.toml files with proper error handling for file system operations and parsing errors. Include validation integration to ensure parsed content matches schema.

# Test Strategy:
Parser tests with malformed TOML, writer round-trip tests, error handling validation, and format preservation tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create base JSON Schema for contracts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational JSON Schema structure that defines the core contract format, including top-level properties, required fields, and basic validation rules
### Details:
Define the root schema with properties for contract version, metadata, theme configuration, layout definitions, and style engine settings. Include proper schema versioning and extensibility patterns.

## 2. Implement theme validation (variants, tokens) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build validation logic for theme configuration including design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and theme variants (light, dark, custom themes)
### Details:
Create schemas for color palettes, typography scales, spacing systems, and variant definitions. Validate token references, inheritance chains, and ensure all theme values conform to expected formats.

## 3. Build layout system validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement validation for layout definitions including grid systems, flexbox configurations, responsive breakpoints, and component layout constraints
### Details:
Validate layout properties like grid templates, flex properties, spacing rules, and breakpoint definitions. Ensure layout configurations are compatible with the rendering engine.

## 4. Add style engine configuration validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create validation for style engine settings including CSS-in-JS configurations, styling strategies, and performance optimization flags
### Details:
Validate style engine options, CSS generation strategies, runtime vs build-time styling flags, and optimization settings. Ensure compatibility with chosen styling libraries.

## 5. Implement runtime requirements validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build validation for runtime dependencies, browser requirements, polyfill needs, and performance constraints specified in contracts
### Details:
Validate browser compatibility targets, required polyfills, performance budgets, and runtime environment constraints. Check for conflicting requirements and missing dependencies.

## 6. Create TypeScript type guards with Zod/Joi [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Implement runtime type validation using Zod or Joi to create type-safe contract parsing with automatic TypeScript type inference
### Details:
Build composable validation schemas using Zod/Joi that mirror the JSON Schema structure. Create type guards for each contract section with proper error messages and type inference.

## 7. Build contract parsing utilities with error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Develop utilities for parsing, validating, and transforming contracts with comprehensive error handling and helpful error messages
### Details:
Create parser functions that validate contracts, provide detailed error locations, suggest fixes for common issues, and transform valid contracts into normalized internal formats.

## 8. Add comprehensive validation test suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.7
### Description: Create extensive test coverage for all validation scenarios including valid contracts, edge cases, and various error conditions
### Details:
Write unit tests for each validation module, integration tests for complete contract validation, and snapshot tests for error messages. Include fixtures for valid and invalid contracts.
