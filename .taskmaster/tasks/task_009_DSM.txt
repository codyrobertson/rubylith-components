# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Registry Integration Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the interface layer that allows the Contract-Driven Component Registry to consume design-system.toml files
# Details:
Implement registry integration module that: exports TOML parsing utilities for registry consumption, provides capability checking functions against component contracts, creates theme provider injection helpers, and supports token/theme lookup for component previews. Ensure sub-100ms performance target for registry operations.

# Test Strategy:
Registry integration tests, capability checking accuracy tests, performance benchmarks for registry operations, and theme injection validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create profile data models and storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core data models for profiles including schema definitions, database tables, and repository patterns for persistent storage
### Details:
Define Profile entity with fields for name, description, mount plan references, metadata, timestamps. Create database migrations, implement repository interface with CRUD operations, add indexing for efficient queries

## 2. Implement profile creation from mount plans [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build functionality to create profiles by capturing and storing mount plan configurations, including all settings and parameters
### Details:
Create profile factory service that reads mount plan data, transforms it into profile format, handles nested configurations, validates completeness, and stores profile with proper associations to source mount plans

## 3. Add versioning with SemVer support [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement semantic versioning system for profiles to track changes and maintain version history
### Details:
Add version field to profile model, implement SemVer parsing and validation, create version increment logic for major/minor/patch changes, maintain version history table, add version comparison utilities

## 4. Build sharing and permissions system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create access control system for profiles with user permissions, sharing capabilities, and role-based access
### Details:
Design permission model with owner/viewer/editor roles, implement sharing API endpoints, add access control checks to all profile operations, create UI for managing permissions, handle permission inheritance

## 5. Create validation against environments [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement validation system to ensure profiles are compatible with target deployment environments
### Details:
Build environment compatibility checker, validate resource requirements, check dependency availability, verify configuration constraints, provide detailed validation reports with actionable feedback

## 6. Implement diff/merge functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Create algorithms to compare profiles and merge changes between different versions or branches
### Details:
Implement deep object comparison for profile structures, create visual diff representation, build three-way merge algorithm, handle merge conflicts with resolution strategies, add conflict resolution UI

## 7. Add import/export with JSON format [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.5
### Description: Build import/export functionality for profiles using standardized JSON format for portability
### Details:
Design JSON schema for profile export format, implement serialization/deserialization logic, add format validation, support bulk import/export operations, handle version compatibility during import
