# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Token and Theme Resolution System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build system to resolve and validate token references and theme configurations from manifest specifications
# Details:
Implement token resolution engine that: parses token files from specified root directory, handles cascade resolution mode, validates namespace references, resolves theme entry points and provider components, and validates theme variant availability. Support multiple token formats (JSON, JS, DTCG) and theme patterns (React Context, styled-components, CSS custom properties).

# Test Strategy:
Token resolution tests across different formats, theme provider validation tests, namespace resolution accuracy tests, and error handling for missing references

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create token file parser for JSON, JS, and DTCG formats [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a token file parser module that can read and parse design tokens from multiple file formats
### Details:
Create a token file parser module that can read and parse design tokens from multiple file formats including JSON (.json), JavaScript (.js), and Design Token Community Group (DTCG) specification formats. The parser should handle format detection, validate token structure, normalize different formats into a consistent internal representation, and provide error handling for malformed token files. Include support for nested token objects, aliases/references between tokens, and metadata extraction from each format type.

## 2. Implement token resolution engine with cascade mode [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build the core token resolution engine that processes tokens in cascade mode for hierarchical token resolution
### Details:
Create token resolution engine that processes tokens in cascade mode, handling inheritance hierarchies and token overrides. Implement cascading logic where child tokens inherit from parent tokens, handle token composition and merging, support default value fallbacks, and manage resolution order based on cascade priority. Include conflict resolution for duplicate token names and optimization for large token sets.

## 3. Build namespace reference validator [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create validation system for token namespace references to ensure valid token paths and dependencies
### Details:
Implement namespace reference validation that checks token path validity, validates cross-namespace references, detects circular dependencies, ensures referenced tokens exist, and validates namespace naming conventions. Support nested namespace structures, provide detailed error messages for invalid references, and include validation for token aliases.

## 4. Create theme entry point resolver [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build resolver for theme entry points that identifies and validates theme configuration files and entry modules
### Details:
Implement theme entry point resolver that discovers theme configuration files, validates theme structure and metadata, resolves theme module exports, handles multiple entry point formats, and provides theme dependency mapping. Support common theme patterns like index files, theme manifests, and dynamic theme loading.

## 5. Implement theme provider component detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create detection system for theme provider components across different UI frameworks and patterns
### Details:
Build theme provider detection that identifies React Context providers, styled-components ThemeProvider, CSS-in-JS theme providers, and custom theme provider patterns. Support automatic provider injection, validate provider component APIs, handle provider composition, and detect theme consumer components.

## 6. Build theme variant availability checker [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create system to validate theme variant availability and compatibility across different theme configurations
### Details:
Implement theme variant checker that validates available theme variants, checks variant compatibility with components, ensures variant completeness, handles variant inheritance, and provides variant availability reporting. Support dark/light modes, brand variants, and custom theme variations.

## 7. Add support for multiple theme patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5, 7.6
### Description: Implement support for various theme implementation patterns including React Context, styled-components, and CSS custom properties
### Details:
Build multi-pattern theme support for React Context patterns, styled-components ThemeProvider, CSS custom properties, CSS-in-JS solutions, and design system specific patterns. Include pattern detection, automatic adaptation between patterns, and cross-pattern compatibility layers.

## 8. Implement token alias and reference resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build comprehensive system for resolving token aliases and references including nested references and computed values
### Details:
Create token alias resolution system that handles direct aliases, nested reference chains, computed token values, conditional references, and reference validation. Support DTCG alias syntax, custom alias patterns, reference cycle detection, and optimized resolution for performance.
