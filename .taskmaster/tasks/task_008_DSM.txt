# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Layout System Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create validation logic for layout system configurations and responsive behavior definitions
# Details:
Build layout validation system that: validates layout system identifiers (grid-12, flexbox, custom), checks responsive configuration validity, validates breakpoint definitions, and ensures layout system compatibility with declared styleEngine. Include support for common layout systems and extensibility for custom configurations.

# Test Strategy:
Layout system validation tests, responsive configuration tests, styleEngine compatibility checks, and custom layout system support tests
