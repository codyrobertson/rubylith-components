# Product Requirements Document: Contract-Driven Component Registry

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a **Contract-Driven Component Registry** system designed to revolutionize how UI engineers and frontend developers manage, version, and deploy components in real-world, design-system-rich environments. The system introduces a paradigm shift from traditional component libraries to a contract-based architecture where components declare execution requirements and environments provide capabilities.

## Vision & Goals

### Primary Vision
Create a versioned registry for UI components where:
- Components declare **execution contracts** specifying their requirements
- Environments offer **execution capabilities** to satisfy contracts
- A **registry** coordinates component-environment matching and builds **mount plans**
- Full support exists for local development, online IDEs, CI/CD, and enterprise design systems

### Key Goals
1. **Portability**: Components work across different environments without modification
2. **Predictability**: Contract validation prevents runtime failures
3. **Scalability**: Support thousands of components across distributed teams
4. **Governance**: Enforce design system compliance and visual consistency
5. **Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflows for both building and consuming components

## Core Concepts

### Component
A versioned, distributable UI module with:
- Semantic versioning (SemVer)
- Declared execution contract
- Self-contained implementation
- Test suites and documentation

### Contract
A declarative specification defining:
- Required theme capabilities
- Token dependencies and versions
- Layout system requirements
- Style engine expectations
- Runtime environment needs

### Environment
A context that provides:
- Theme implementations
- Token resolution
- Layout systems
- Style engines
- Runtime capabilities

### Capability
A unit of support provided by environments:
- Theme variants (light/dark)
- Token sets and versions
- Layout grids (12-column, flexbox)
- Style engines (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS)

### Mount Plan
A generated strategy to render components:
- Environment-component compatibility check
- Wrapper and adapter injection
- Context provider setup
- Token resolution strategy

### Profile
A reusable mount plan template:
- Named configuration sets
- Environment snapshots
- Token version locks
- Theme specifications

## User Personas

### Frontend Developer
**Goals:**
- Quickly build and ship components
- Ensure components work across environments
- Maintain local development efficiency

**Pain Points:**
- Environment-specific bugs
- Complex dependency management
- Inconsistent theming

### UI Engineer
**Goals:**
- Maintain visual consistency
- Enforce design token usage
- Manage theme variations

**Pain Points:**
- Token version drift
- Visual regression detection
- Cross-platform consistency

### Design System Owner
**Goals:**
- Governance and compliance
- Component auditability
- System-wide updates

**Pain Points:**
- Adoption tracking
- Breaking change management
- Documentation maintenance

## Technical Requirements

### Versioning Strategy

#### Component Versioning (SemVer)
- **Patch (1.0.x)**: Bug fixes, style tweaks, no API changes
- **Minor (1.x.0)**: New props/features, backward compatible
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, removed features

#### Contract Versioning
- Contracts version independently from components
- Contract changes trigger component version bumps:
  - Added capability → minor bump
  - Changed requirement → major bump
  - Removed requirement → major bump

#### Environment Versioning
- Environments declare compatibility ranges
- Support for static binding and dynamic matching
- Compatibility matrix maintenance

### Contract Schema

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "component": {
    "name": "Card",
    "version": "2.1.0"
  },
  "contract": {
    "theme": {
      "required": true,
      "variants": ["light", "dark"]
    },
    "tokens": {
      "package": "@company/tokens",
      "version": "^2.3.0",
      "required": ["spacing", "colors", "typography"]
    },
    "layout": {
      "system": "grid-12",
      "responsive": true
    },
    "styleEngine": {
      "type": "tailwind",
      "version": "^3.0.0"
    },
    "runtime": {
      "framework": "react",
      "version": "^18.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Registry API

#### Component Operations
- `POST /components` - Publish new component
- `GET /components/{name}` - Get component details
- `GET /components/{name}/versions` - List versions
- `GET /components/{name}/contract` - Get contract

#### Environment Operations
- `POST /environments` - Register environment
- `GET /environments/{id}/capabilities` - List capabilities
- `POST /environments/{id}/validate` - Validate component

#### Mount Plan Operations
- `POST /mount-plans/generate` - Generate mount plan
- `GET /mount-plans/{id}` - Get mount plan details
- `POST /mount-plans/{id}/execute` - Execute mount plan

### Task Lattice Implementation

The development will follow a Task Lattice (DAG) structure where:
- Tasks are atomic and independently testable
- Dependencies form a directed acyclic graph
- Parallel execution is maximized
- Feedback loops enable continuous improvement

### Systems Thinking Approach

Development incorporates:
- Causal relationship mapping
- Feedback loop integration
- Holistic system optimization
- Emergent behavior monitoring

### Gated Development Stages

Each task progresses through:
1. **Draft**: Requirements defined
2. **Ready**: Dependencies resolved
3. **In Progress**: Active development
4. **Code Complete**: Implementation done
5. **Ready for Merge**: All validations passed

This ensures quality gates at each stage while maintaining development velocity.
